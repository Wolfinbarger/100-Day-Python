# Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name.
# You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.
# Ex input Angela
#     output 6
# Answer print( len( input("What is your name?") ) )

# Python variables
# name = input("What is your name?")

# print(name)

# name = "Angela"

# name = input("What is your name?")
# length = len(name)

# print(length)
